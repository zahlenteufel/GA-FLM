This example data comes from the CoNLL 2000 Shared Task, and is originally prepared by Lance Ramshaw and Mitchell Marcus [RM95]. 

Specifically, this data set contains section 20 of the Wall Street Journal corpus. The factors are "W", "P", and "C". "W" are the words. "P" are the part-of-speech tags as derived by the Brill tagger. "C" are the noun-phrase chunking tags derived from the Wall Street Journal corpus.
